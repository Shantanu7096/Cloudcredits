# 🎥 Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project aims to build a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their **past ratings**. Using the **MovieLens dataset**, the system applies **Collaborative Filtering** to provide personalized movie recommendations.  

---

## 📂 Dataset Information  

**Dataset:** MovieLens Dataset  
**Features Included:**  
- **User ID:** Identifies the user  
- **Movie ID:** Represents the movie  
- **Ratings:** A numerical rating given by a user  
- **Timestamp:** The time when the rating was given  

This dataset is widely used for testing **recommendation algorithms**.

## 🏗️ Project Steps  

### 📊 Data Preprocessing  
1. **Load Dataset** from CSV or dataset API.  
2. **Handle Missing Values** (if any).  
3. **Convert Data into Matrix Format** for collaborative filtering.  
4. **Normalize Ratings** to improve recommendations.  

### 🤖 Model Training  
- Implement **Collaborative Filtering** (user-based or item-based).  
- Train the model using historical ratings.  

### 📈 Model Evaluation  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures prediction accuracy.  
- **Precision & Recall:** (Optional) To evaluate recommendation quality.  

### 🖼️ Visualization  
- **Heatmap of User Ratings:** Shows rating patterns.  
- **Top Recommended Movies per User:** Presents personalized movie picks.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas surprise matplotlib
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Script  
```bash
python movie_recommender.py
```

- This will train the recommendation model and display **suggested movies for users**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

- Test with **Deep Learning-based** recommendation models.  
- Implement **Hybrid Filtering** (combining collaborative + content-based filtering).  
- Deploy the model using **Flask or FastAPI** for real-time recommendations.
